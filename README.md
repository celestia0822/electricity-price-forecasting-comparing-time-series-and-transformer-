# Electricity Price Forecasting with Renewable Energy Data

## Overview
Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in modern power system planning, electricity market operations, and energy risk management. As countries around the world advance toward carbon neutrality, power systems are undergoing a rapid transition toward low-carbon energy structures. The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources—particularly wind and solar—has fundamentally changed electricity market dynamics.

Unlike conventional power generation, renewable energy output is inherently intermittent and highly dependent on weather conditions. This variability introduces new patterns of volatility into electricity markets, affecting short-term supply–demand balance, generation dispatch decisions, and ultimately electricity prices. Accurately capturing these dynamics is essential for improving price forecasts and supporting efficient market decision-making.

## Project Objective
This project investigates whether incorporating renewable energy information can improve electricity price forecasting accuracy. Specifically, it evaluates the predictive contribution of renewable-related variables—such as renewable energy share, solar irradiance, and wind speed—within electricity price forecasting models.

The central research question is:
**Can renewable energy data meaningfully enhance short-term electricity price forecasts?**

## Methodology
To answer this question, the project compares:
- **Time-Series forecasting models** that rely solely on traditional market and price information
- **Deep learning models** that explicitly incorporate renewable energy variables

Forecast performance is evaluated by comparing models with and without renewable energy features to assess whether renewable variability explains additional price movements beyond conventional predictors.

## Key Features
- Integration of renewable energy and weather-related data into price forecasting models  
- Comparison between traditional approaches and machine learning-based models  
- Quantitative evaluation of forecast accuracy improvements  
- Focus on short-term electricity price dynamics under high renewable penetration  

## Insights and Applications
The findings of this project provide insights into how renewable energy variability influences electricity market behavior. Understanding these relationships can help:
- Grid operators improve operational planning  
- Market participants and traders enhance short-term pricing strategies  
- Policymakers better assess the market impact of renewable integration  
- Renewable developers evaluate market risks associated with variability  

By demonstrating the value (or limitations) of renewable energy information in price forecasting, this project contributes to the development of more reliable and transparent electricity markets in a low-carbon energy future.
